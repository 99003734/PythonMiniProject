## Introduction-
* In this python project, we have to read multiple excel sheet data having 40 rows x 10 column that contain 3 similar columns in each sheet i.e. PS number, Name & Email address. Next, we have to take the user input for printing the desired student data in a master sheet. Here we are reading the multiple sheet and storing the similar student data into master sheet.
* Excel files should be placed in different directories and Master file should get the
data from all excel files with respect to user input
